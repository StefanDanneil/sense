# Sense

Sense is the repository for my home monitoring system. The idea is as follows:

1 - You spin up microcontrollers with wifi access and the type of sensor you want

2 - The microcontrollers report back with a set interval to our express API-backend

3 - The express API powers a dashboard that provide your metrics in a sensible fasion

4 - ????

5 - profit
